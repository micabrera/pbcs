About Us

Zoobie Pets & trade; are incredibly easy to use. The durable velcro latches are child friendly and are easily unfastened to transform the animals into soft pillows. The zippers located on the bottom of the animal easily unzip to reveal the blanket inside. Each blanket can be detached from the animal for easy washing. Each animal comes with an instructional hangtag that illustrates how to properly fold up the banket &-a simple and easy-to-follow three-step process.
